# CRM Mini Application

## Description
CRM Mini is a learning project built with Spring Boot.  
Initially, the idea was to create a booking application, but during development it evolved into a lightweight CRM system for managing client data.

The main goal of this project is to practice core Spring concepts such as:
- layered architecture
- Spring Data JPA
- working with a database
- Docker-based setup

---

##  Functionality
- Create a client
- Edit/update client data
- Delete a client
- Download client data

##  Architecture
The application follows a classic layered architecture:

- **Controller** – handles HTTP requests
- **Service** – contains business logic
- **Repository** – interacts with the database
- **Entity** – represents the data model

---

## Tools used
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- React
- Docker
